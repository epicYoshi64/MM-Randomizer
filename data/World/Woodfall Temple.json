# Comments should be made using hash signs, since that's what the parser splits on.
# Any region defined will become a Region object
# Any location defined will become a Location object with the region it's in as the parent_region
#   with the key as name of the location and value as the access_rule
# Any exit defined will become an Entrance object from the region it's in to the region that's
#   the key string. The value string is the access rule for that entrance.
